Your project now has a **`start-all.sh`** script that:

1. Starts MySQL in Podman
2. Loads the schema and test data
3. Builds and runs the Spring Boot app

[ðŸ“¥ Download vehicle-api-full-local-run-podman-fixed-all.zip](sandbox:/mnt/data/vehicle-api-full-local-run-podman-fixed-all.zip)

You can now simply run:

```bash
./start-all.sh
```

â€¦and then visit **[http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)** to test the seeded API.

Do you want me to also make the Spring Boot app **auto-restart on code changes** for local development?
